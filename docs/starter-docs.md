# Overview
You will prototype a new semantic recommendation feature for an e-commerce website’s fashion product line. Traditionally, users have relied on keyword-based search (e.g., “t-shirt” or “shorts”), but the goal is to enable human-like queries (e.g., “I need an outfit to go to the beach this summer”). Your job is to build a simple microservice that:
Parses a user’s natural-language query
Finds relevant products from a provided dataset using semantic search and LLMs
You will expose this functionality through a function, command-line tool, or API endpoint. If you’d like, you may also create a minimal front-end to demonstrate how an end user might interact with your service.
 
## Requirements & Deliverables
Architecture Diagram
Include a high-level view of your system in JPEG or PDF.
Show how data is processed from the provided dataset through to the user’s query response.
Full Executable Code (Microservice)
Focus on clarity and modularity
Provide a README explaining:
Project setup (how to install or run)
Sample usage (e.g., a test query and the resulting recommendations)
Key design decisions and trade-offs
(Optional) Additional Exploration
Any notebooks or scripts you used to explore the data, experiment with embeddings or LLM prompts, etc.
Additional documentation clarifying your approach or next steps.
